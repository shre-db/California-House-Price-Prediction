Overview
--------
This is a guided project from the book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron. This is my first ever end-to-end machine learning project, where I discovered the data science project life cycle and awesome Scikit-Learn tools for machine learning. This end-to-end project involves understanding the business problem, gathering data, Exploratory Data Analysis, preparing the data for machine learning algorithms using pipelines, model training and evaluation using cross-validation, Fine-tuning models with GridSearchCV and a brief about presenting solution, launching, monitoring and maintaining the system.
